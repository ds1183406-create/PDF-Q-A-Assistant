ðŸ“‘ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project Name: Multi-Modal AI PDF Assistant
Owner: [Your Name]
Date: [Todayâ€™s Date]
Version: 1.0

1. Overview

The Multi-Modal AI PDF Assistant is a web application that allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with them using natural language queries.
The system will leverage LangChain + FastAPI for orchestration, React for the frontend, and Google Gemini 2.5 (Pro + Flash Vision) for reasoning over text, tables, and images.

The assistant will:

Extract text, tables, and images from PDFs.

Store them in a vector database (Chroma/FAISS).

Answer user questions using context-aware retrieval (RAG).

Handle multi-modal content such as tables, diagrams, and charts.

Provide clean, user-friendly responses with references.

2. Goals & Objectives

Build a portfolio-grade AI app that demonstrates advanced skills in AI development, web development, and multi-modal reasoning.

Showcase expertise in:

AI tools (LangChain, Gemini 2.5, Hugging Face APIs)

Backend frameworks (FastAPI, Django, Streamlit)

Frontend frameworks (React, Tailwind, Material UI)

Create a foundation that can later be extended into a SaaS product.

3. Target Users

Freelance clients (businesses, researchers, consultants) who need insights from large PDFs.

Students/Researchers analyzing academic papers.

Business analysts reviewing reports with charts & financial tables.

4. Key Features
4.1 Must-Have (MVP)

PDF Upload â†’ support documents up to 20MB.

Text Extraction â†’ extract paragraphs & store embeddings.

Table Extraction â†’ detect tables, parse into structured data, generate embeddings.

Image Extraction & Understanding â†’ extract charts/diagrams, analyze with Gemini 2.5 Flash Vision.

Q&A Chat â†’ users ask questions, system retrieves relevant context & responds.

Chat Memory â†’ remembers previous turns for contextual answers.

Frontend Chat UI (React) â†’ supports file upload, chat interface, and references display.

4.2 Nice-to-Have (Advanced)

Table Rendering â†’ display structured tables in chat answers.

Image Previews â†’ show referenced images (charts, diagrams).

Multi-PDF Support â†’ query across multiple uploaded documents.

Export â†’ download extracted tables as CSV or answers as PDF.

Theming â†’ dark/light mode for UI.

5. Technical Requirements
Backend (FastAPI + LangChain)

FastAPI for API endpoints (/upload, /chat).

LangChain for RAG pipeline.

Gemini 2.5 Pro for text reasoning.

Gemini 2.5 Flash Vision for image/chart understanding.

PyPDF2 / pdfplumber for text & table extraction.

pdf2image for image extraction.

Chroma/FAISS as vector database.

SQLite/Postgres (optional) for persistent chat memory.

Frontend (React)

React 18+ for SPA.

TailwindCSS / Material UI for styling.

Axios for API calls.

Chat UI: user input, AI responses, references, table/image previews.

Deployment

Backend â†’ Hugging Face Spaces / Railway / Render.

Frontend â†’ Vercel / Netlify.

Environment Variables â†’ secure API key storage.

6. User Stories

As a user, I can upload a PDF so that I can interact with its content.

As a user, I can ask questions about the document and receive contextually accurate answers.

As a user, I can ask about a table and get structured data in response.

As a user, I can ask about a chart or diagram and receive a meaningful explanation.

As a user, I can see sources (page numbers or snippets) for every answer.

As a user, I can continue a conversation with memory of prior context.

7. Success Metrics

âœ… Able to process PDFs up to 20MB.

âœ… Answer accuracy > 85% for text-based questions.

âœ… Correctly parse and return tables in at least 90% of cases.

âœ… Image/chart explanations consistent with human interpretation.

âœ… Average response time < 7 seconds.

8. Risks & Mitigation

Risk: Large PDFs may exceed API limits.

Mitigation: Chunk text into smaller pieces; compress images.

Risk: Table parsing errors on complex layouts.

Mitigation: Fall back to Vision API for OCR-based understanding.

Risk: API cost for Gemini 2.5 Vision.

Mitigation: Cache embeddings and image analysis results.

9. Timeline (Suggested Roadmap)

Week 1: Project setup, FastAPI + React boilerplate, Gemini API integration.

Week 2: Text extraction + RAG pipeline with LangChain.

Week 3: Table extraction & integration.

Week 4: Image extraction + Gemini Flash Vision integration.

Week 5: Frontend chat UI (upload + chat + references).

Week 6: Testing, polish UI, prepare portfolio demo (deploy).

10. Deliverables

âœ… GitHub repo with clean code (backend + frontend).

âœ… Deployed demo app (Hugging Face Spaces + Vercel).

âœ… Documentation (README with setup instructions).

âœ… Portfolio case study (screenshots + video demo).
